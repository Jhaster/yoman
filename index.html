    <h1>My Favorite Hobby:

        <div>Coding.</div>

    </h1>

    <p id="bio">Coding, can make the world a better place. No matter what you think to use it for, no matter what you code, coding can always help us. A reason for coding is it increases your creativity skills. You are learning a new language, actually 3 main languages. Coding can always be some cool, fun use of free time and not only help others it can even help you.</p>

    <p id="Bio">Coding is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites, and software. Without it, we’d have none of the most popular technology we’ve come to rely on such as Facebook, our smartphones, the browser we choose to view our favorite blogs, or even the blogs themselves. It all runs on code.</p>
